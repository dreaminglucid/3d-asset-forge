# 3D Asset Forge

A comprehensive React/Vite application for AI-powered 3D asset generation, rigging, and fitting. Built for the Hyperscape RPG, this system combines OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALL-E with Meshy.ai to create game-ready 3D models from text descriptions.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ **AI-Powered Asset Generation**
- Generate 3D models from text descriptions using GPT-4 and Meshy.ai
- Automatic concept art creation with DALL-E
- Support for various asset types: weapons, armor, characters, items
- Material variant generation (bronze, steel, mithril, etc.)
- Batch generation capabilities

### ðŸŽ® **3D Asset Management**
- Interactive 3D viewer with Three.js
- Asset library with categorization and filtering
- Metadata management and asset organization
- GLB/GLTF format support

### ðŸ¤– **Advanced Rigging & Fitting**
- **Armor Fitting System**: Automatically fit armor pieces to character models
- **Hand Rigging**: AI-powered hand pose detection and weapon rigging
- Weight transfer and mesh deformation
- Bone mapping and skeleton alignment

### ðŸ”§ **Processing Tools**
- Sprite generation from 3D models
- Vertex color extraction
- T-pose extraction from animated models
- Asset normalization and optimization

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei
- **State Management**: Zustand, Immer
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Meshy.ai API
- **ML/Computer Vision**: TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe (hand detection)
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Bun [[memory:4609218]]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- API keys for OpenAI and Meshy.ai

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd packages/generation
```

2. Install dependencies using Bun [[memory:4609218]]
```bash
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file from the example
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

4. Add your API keys to `.env`
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
VITE_MESHY_API_KEY=your-meshy-api-key
```

### Running the Application

Start both frontend and backend services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the React app
bun run dev:all

# Or run separately:
bun run dev           # Terminal 1: Frontend only
bun run dev:backend   # Terminal 2: Backend services
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3003`
