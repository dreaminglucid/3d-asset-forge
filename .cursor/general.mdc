- Never use defensive programming, we want to fail fast and hrd so that we alwasy see our errors clearly.
- Do not make new files when fixing existing features, always fix the issues within the file we already have unless instructed otherwise.
- Never us the "any" or "unknown" types, always use strong types.
- Use zustand for state management.
- Always modularize frontend code into componenets when it makes sense.
- Put constants into our constants folder.
- always use common componenets when designing new ui elements.
