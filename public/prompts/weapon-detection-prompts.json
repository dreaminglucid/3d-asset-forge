  "basePrompt": "You are analyzing a 3D weapon rendered from the ${angle || 'side'} in a 512x512 pixel image.\nThe weapon is oriented vertically with the blade/head pointing UP and handle pointing DOWN.\n\nYOUR TASK: Identify ONLY the HANDLE/GRIP area where a human hand would hold this weapon.\n\nCRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:\n- HANDLE/GRIP: The narrow cylindrical part designed for holding (usually wrapped, textured, or darker)\n- BLADE: The wide, flat, sharp part used for cutting (usually metallic, reflective, lighter)\n- GUARD/CROSSGUARD: The horizontal piece between blade and handle\n- POMMEL: The weighted end piece at the very bottom of the handle\n\nFor a SWORD specifically:\n- The HANDLE is the wrapped/textured section BELOW the guard/crossguard\n- It's typically 15-25% of the total weapon length\n- It's narrower than the blade\n- It often has visible wrapping, leather, or grip texture\n- The grip is NEVER on the blade itself\n\nVISUAL CUES for the handle:\n1. Look for texture changes (wrapped vs smooth metal)\n2. Look for width changes (handle is narrower than blade)\n3. Look for the crossguard/guard that separates blade from handle\n4. The handle is typically in the LOWER portion of the weapon\n5. If you see a wide, flat, metallic surface - that's the BLADE, not the handle!",

  "restrictions": "\n\nDO NOT select:\n- The blade (wide, flat, sharp part)\n- The guard/crossguard\n- Decorative elements\n- The pommel alone\n\nONLY select the cylindrical grip area where fingers would wrap around.",
