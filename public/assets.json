The width is relatively thin, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout the body, tapering slightly towards the tips.\n\n2. Structure: The bow's body is made up of a single, solid, elongated piece curving into a semi-circle at the top and bottom, connecting at the center to form the grip. The bowstring runs from one tip of the bow to the other, forming a tight line that bisects the bow's curve. \n\n3. Details: The grip in the middle is slightly thicker with small horizontal grooves for hand placement, providing a hint of realism without specific textures. The ends of the bow, where the bowstring attaches, feature small, simple, cylindrical shapes for the notches. The bowstring is a thin, straight line with slight angular bends at the points where it attaches to the bow's tips.\n\n4. Colors: The bow, including the grip and notches, is rendered in a neutral gray, while the bowstring is white. No specific wood textures or colors are applied, making it suitable for retexturing.\n\n5. Style: The design maintains the simple, low-poly aesthetic of RuneScape 2007.

It is approximately 6 units in length, maintaining a consistent diameter of 0.2 units throughout, except at the ends. The rod is segmented into three even sections, separated by slightly thicker bands of 0.3 units, which will allow for easy retexturing. \n\nThe bottom of the rod flares out to a 0.5 unit diameter, creating a handle, which is 1.5 units in length. The handle is distinguished by a slight curvature for gripping ease. \n\nThe top end of the rod tapers slightly to a point over the last 0.5 unit of its length. Attached to this end is a thin, low-poly line that hangs down 4 units. The line ends with a simple, geometrical hook model. The hook is a basic curve shape, crafted from a 0.1 unit diameter cylindrical geometry, extending 0.4 units in length.\n\nThe entire model is rendered in a neutral grey color, perfect for retexturing. The simple, clean geometry and clear shapes make this model versatile for applying various textures and colors while maintaining the recognizable silhouette of a fishing rod. The style is consistent with the low-poly, old school RuneScape 2007 aesthetic.",

Face Opening: The helmet features a rectangular face opening, extending from just above the eyebrow level to the base of the chin, and reaching the width of the face on either side. The opening is defined by clean, sharp lines.\n\n3. Visor: Above the face opening, the helmet features a small, flat visor that protrudes forward slightly. The visor is a simple rectangular shape, adding to the geometric aesthetic of the model.\n\n4. Neck Guard: At the base of the helmet, extending from the back to the sides, a semi-circular neck guard is present.

Each piece is rectangular, tapering slightly towards the bottom to accommodate the shape of the leg. The top of each piece flares out slightly to accommodate the thigh. The overall shape closely follows the form of a human leg, ensuring a snug fit when worn.\n\nGeometry:\nThe armor pieces are low-poly, consisting of simple shapes with clear and clean lines. Each piece is composed of a front and back panel, joined at the sides with small, rectangular strips representing stitching or fastenings. The geometry of these stitching strips is simple, straight, and untextured. \n\nDesign Details:\nAt the knee, each armor piece has a slightly raised, rounded shape to allow for knee movement. This is represented by a simple, curved line on the model. The bottom of each piece ends just above the ankle, with the geometry slightly curving inward to represent the narrowing of the leg at this point.\n\nColor:\nThe base model is presented in a neutral light gray color, devoid of any specific material textures. It is ready for retexturing with different materials later.\n\nStyle:\nThe model aligns with Old School RuneScape 2007 aesthetics. It has a low poly count, simple shapes, and an iconic silhouette. Despite its simplicity, it is recognizable as leg armor.",

      "detailedPrompt": "Model: Basic Metal Leg Armor\n\n1. Overall Shape:\nThe leg armor is designed to cover the entire leg region, from the waist down to the feet. It possesses a slightly curved, cylindrical shape that tapers down from the upper thigh to the ankle, emulating the natural form of a human leg. The knee section protrudes slightly for flexibility and articulation.\n\n2. Geometry:\nThe armor is low-poly, with simple, clean geometry. The polygons are evenly distributed, with more concentration around the knee for better articulation and less concentration on the thigh and calf regions to maintain a smooth, streamlined look. The foot region is shaped like a simple boot, with a flat bottom and a rounded top that covers the ankle.\n\n3. Design:\nThe design is neutral and minimalist, with no ornamental details. The only feature is a series of horizontal ridges that run around the thigh, knee, and calf regions, providing an illusion of segments for mobility. The waist area slightly flares out to allow room for the torso.\n\n4. Color:\nThe armor is rendered in neutral tones of gray to avoid suggesting any specific material. The coloration is consistent across the entire model, with slight variations in shading to highlight the ridges and the knee protrusion.\n\n5. Style:\nThe style is reminiscent of RuneScape 2007, featuring an iconic silhouette that is easily recognizable despite the low poly count. The silhouette is characterized by its slight tapering, the mild protrusion at the",

The armor is split into two main parts: the thigh guard and the shin guard. \n\nStarting from the top, the thigh guard is shaped like an inverted trapezoid with rounded edges, tapering slightly towards the top. It is designed to extend from mid-thigh to just above the knee, providing full coverage. \n\nThe knee cap is a separate circular piece that acts as a bridge between the thigh and shin guards. It protrudes slightly, adding a level of depth to the model.\n\nThe shin guard extends from below the knee to the ankle. It is shaped like a long rectangle with rounded edges, slightly bending forward at the knee and tapering towards the ankle to mimic the natural shape of a leg. \n\nBoth the thigh and shin guards are divided into two sections - front and back, connected on the sides by simple rectangular straps, suggesting that they can be fastened and unfastened.\n\nThe entire model is rendered in a neutral gray color, making it ideal for retexturing. Edges are well-defined, and faces are flat, maintaining a clean, simple geometry throughout. The model does not include any textures, ensuring it is suitable for applying different materials later.\n\nThe silhouette is iconic and easily recognizable as leg armor, despite the simplicity of the model.

      "detailedPrompt": "The basic shield model takes on a traditional round shape with a diameter roughly 1.5 times the length of the average player's arm. It tapers slightly towards the edges, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout. The edge of the shield is reinforced with a simple raised rim, adding some depth to the otherwise flat surface.\n\nThe shield's face is divided into two concentric circles. The outer circle spans the shield's rim to just a quarter way in, while the inner circle forms the shield's center. The space between these two circles is slightly recessed, creating a shallow groove that adds visual interest without complicating the model's geometry.\n\nOn the back of the shield, there's a simple handle for the player to hold. The handle is an elongated oval shape, positioned horizontally and attached securely to the shield's center. The handle stands out slightly from the shield's back, making it clear that it's a separate element.\n\nThe entire shield model is rendered in a neutral gray color. The model's geometry is clean and simple, with a low poly count consistent with the RuneScape 2007 style. This shield's iconic silhouette and basic design make it an ideal base for retexturing with various materials.",
